# Machine-Learning---CS60050 IITKGP
Assignments of ML course at IITKGP. Contains Functions of ML algorithms coded without inbuilt libraries





## Assignment 2 
### **Bayesian Classification with Dimension Reduction and Recursive Backward Feature Selection**

As part of our course structure, this algorithm has been built from scratch using Python without any inbuilt functions
As a result, you might find handpicked domain based feature selection, hyperparamater fine tuning and algorithmic modification that enhances performance.
*Our Bayesian Model outperforms the inbuilt Sklearn model by 10% on 5Fold CV accuracy*

In this Project, we perform Bayesian Classification (Naive Bayes) on a training sample of size 300000, to predict if a person will accept a car loan or not.
The Code folder contains 3 modules:
- The Complete code
- The Dimensionality Reduction using PCA retaining 95% variance
- Recursive Backward Feature Selection

The Report explains the procedure and best practices followed during the algorithm building phase.
The Results contains the Inferences and performance of our Bayesian model in classification.
README file has been attached to help you run the code.

## Assignment 1 
### **Regression Tree from Scratch along with recursive Post Pruning**

As part of our coding assignments, this algorithm has been built from scratch using Python without any inbuilt functions.

In this Project, we perfrom Regression Tree with hanpicked heuristics (similar to Entropy and Information Gain) to achieve a 96% accuracy for prediction of Number of Covid Deaths in India per day.
The Code folder contains:
 - The function to build the deepest Decision Tree (Regression) using Greedy approach of best split at each stage (highest information gain)
 - The second part consists of pruning the tree using Reduced Error Pruning method. This is a recursive function that deletes nodes until validation accuracy stops increasing.
 
 The Report provides further insights into the methodolgy used for node selection, heuristics for splits and post pruning. 
 README file has been attached to help you run the code.
